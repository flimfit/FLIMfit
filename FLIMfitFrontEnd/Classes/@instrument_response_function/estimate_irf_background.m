function estimate_irf_background(obj)
    
%> Estimate the IRF background level.
    
% Try to fit to two gaussians, one for peak and one for background. 
% Theoretically not as good as fitting to a gauss + constant but seems 
% to converge better. In general the background just has a very large 
% sigma. The background is the mean of the smaller 'peak'
